The Supreme Court on Monday terminated the mandate of its Committee of Administrators (CoA) to manage the affairs of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to overcome suspension of the Indian football body by FIFA.

A Bench said it was modifying its orders while bearing in mind the “unquestioned importance” of having India host the Under-17 Women’s World Cup in October.

“The court is passing this order to ensure that the prestige of the nation in holding the Under 17 Women’s World Cup is not affected and to enable players to participate in international events,” Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, heading the Bench, observed orally.
