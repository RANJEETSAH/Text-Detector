Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Monday said the BJP had approached him with an offer to have all cases against him closed if he joined the party.

“My reply to BJP — I am a descendant of Maharana Pratap and a Rajput. I am ready to get beheaded but can never bow before conspirators and corrupt people. All the cases against me are false. Do whatever you want to do,” Mr. Sisodia said in a tweet in Hindi.

The BJP said the Deputy Chief Minister was making such comments as he was trying to deflect the corruption charges against him.

Mr. Sisodia, in his tweet, said that the BJP had offered to make him the Chief Ministerial candidate. “Arvind Kejriwalji is my political guru, I will never betray him. I did not come to become CM, my dream is that every child of the country gets good education, only then will India become the number one country. Only Kejriwalji can do this work in the whole country.”
