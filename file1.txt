Most political parties in Jammu & Kashmir, except the BJP, on Monday opposed the move to implement the Representation of the People Act, 1951 in the Union Territory and to allow outsiders to register as voters for the Assembly election.

“The fallout of granting voting rights to non-J&K residents will be that the next Assembly will be in the hands of outsiders. We do not accept this. We have differences but all parties present here have come together realising that tomorrow, we could be left out of our Assembly,” former Chief Minister and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah, who convened the multi-party meeting in Srinagar, said.

Dr. Abdullah said the leaders who had participated in the meeting had “unanimously decided to oppose the recent announcement of the Election Commission of India about granting voting rights to non-J&K residents”. “We can even approach the court to oppose the move,” he said.
